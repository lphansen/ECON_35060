# Risk Uncertainty Value

`Expansion Suite` is an open source Python toolbox for macro-finance research. It solves the nonlinear DSGE model with recursive utility formulation motivated by robustness or risk concerns based on the small-noise expansion method.



`Expansion Suite` is built on the Linear Quadratic framework proposed by [Boroviƒçka and Hansen (2014)](https://larspeterhansen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Examining-Macroeconomic-Models-through-the-Lens-of-Asset-Pricing.pdf). It follows the algorithm in [Exploring Recursive Utility](https://larspeterhansen.org/class-notes/) to approximate the model solution under uncertainty. 



We look forward to your comments and appreciate your feedback!

## Installation and Usage

We can directly download the whole GitHub repo to use the `Expansion Suite`. We can also use all functions in the  `Expansion Suite` from the Python package `mfrpy`.

One line code

```python
pip install mfrpy
```

Upgrade with one line code

```python
pip install --upgrade mfrpy
```

After installation, we can import the modules and functions from `mfrpy` in the Jupyter notebook.

```python
from mfrpy.uncertain_expansion import uncertain_expansion
from mfrpy.elasticity import exposure_elasticity, price_elasticity
from mfrpy.lin_quad import LinQuadVar
```

For example, we can solve the nonlinear DSGE model with `uncertain_expansion` as shown in the notebook using five inputs

```
ModelSol = uncertain_expansion(eq, ss, var_shape, args, gc)
```

We can use the `exposure_elasticity` , `price_elasticity` to calcalute the shock elasticities of the variables we are interested in. We can also compute the shock elasticties for all jump and state variables in the model using the method `elasticities` defined in the `ModelSolution` class.

```python
expo_elas = exposure_elasticity(log_M_growth, X1_tp1, X2_tp1, T=400, shock=0)
price_elas = price_elasticity(log_G_growth, log_S_growth, X1_tp1, X2_tp1, T=400, shock=0)
expo_elas, price_elas = ModelSol.elasticities(log_SDF_ex, T=400, shock=0)
```
